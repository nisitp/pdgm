Your best sales leads are visiting your website - anonymously. Get details about companies and the people who work there without any web registration.

== Description ==

> The fact is, every prospect is going to visit your website.  But **less than 2% of web visitors ever fill out a form.**   This means most potential customers are invisible to you - even the best sales leads. Research shows that often these prospects are 65% of the way though the decision process by the time they finally do engage with your company.

VisitorTrack is a real-time application for B2B organizations that lets you **see who's on your website** and exactly what they're looking at. Detailed **information about companies and the people who work there** are provided without any registration action. With VisitorTrack you can convert anonymous website visitors into sales leads. This helps you connect sooner with potential customers, and puts your sales team back in control of the buyer decision journey. Use this WordPress plugin to generate a VisitorTrack account, start a free trial, and to add the tracking code into your website's pages.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Why would we use this? =

Imagine a new business prospect &ndash; one which meets all of your key qualifications &ndash; visits your website five times and looks at 20, 30, or 40 pages. But they leave and never fill out a form. Wouldn't you like to know the details about this? And if you did, how could this information power your selling team and marketing capabilities in new and more efficient ways?

Just like any web analytics tool, we rely upon an invisible javascript tracking code placed into your site's pages.

No. We offer different tracking script options.

= We want to track the consumers who come to our website &ndash; do you do this? =

VisitorTrack provides detailed information about the organizations and business who visit your website and not about individuals. In fact, an artificial intelligence is used to "filter out" the visits which originate from ISPs and web crawling agents.

We offer a variety of pricing plans along with a free trial - check out the [link](http://netfactor.com/plan-information "Pricing & Plans") page for available options.

We use many differing commercial information and data providers to distill the most detail which can be obtained about your site's business visitors. No website scraping is performed

= Can we integrate this into the other sales and marketing apps we use? =

Yes. We provide capabilities which enable seamless and automated integration of record data into hundreds of web-based applications in CRM, Email, and Marketing Automation.

We are eager to work with our users to help them set up and manage their VisitorTrack service, and how to extract the most value from the real-time intelligence on anonymous website visitors.

Many new users find the intelligence from VisitorTrack about their anonymous site visitors valuable and select a service plan.
